            <p>Yearning to make friends and perform live with a band, lonely and socially anxious 
              Hitori "Bocchi" Gotou devotes her time to playing the guitar. On a fateful day, 
              Bocchi meets the outgoing drummer Nijika Ijichi, who invites her to join Kessoku Band 
              when their guitarist, Ikuyo Kita, flees before their first show. 
              Soon after, Bocchi meets her final bandmate—the cool bassist Ryou Yamada. -

            <p>An extreme introvert who has trouble with most social interactions. 
              Despite becoming incredibly skilled at playing guitar and having a 
              small fanbase online (under the alias "guitarhero"), 
              she still has not been able to make friends as easily until

              and their father disappeared. She's very kind, cheerful, friendly and 
              outgoing, and is the one holding the group together and helping Bocchi 
              with her social anxiety the most.</p>

            <p>She often spends what allowance she gets from her family on new music

            <p>The <b><i>vocalist and secondary guitarist</i></b> of Kessoku Band, 
              who attends the same high school as Hitori.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Hitori, she is a cheerful, charismatic extrovert 
              who has an active social life, to the point that her extroversion 
              manifests as an overwhelming aura at times. She initially joined 
              Kessoku Band to get closer to Ryo, whom she has a crush on, 
              but fled after lying about her guitar playing skills. With Bocchi's help, 
              she becomes a decent guitar player in her own right, and soon settles 
              on playing secondary guitar and providing the band's main vocals.</p>
